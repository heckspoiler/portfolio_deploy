## Introduction

This project is my personal portfolio which is used for jobhunting. It's written in vanilla JS, CSS and HTML, supplemented by various libraries and frameworks which are mentioned below.

## Getting Started

Just few information about the technologies I used, what I've learned and new things I've come across

### Used technologies & libraries

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Axios for data fetching ( `npm install axios`)
- dotenv for keeping all credentials secret(`npm install dotenv --save`)
- express.js for the backend (`npm install express`)
- nodemailer for the email handling (`npm install nodemailer`)
- vanilla tilt for a smooth, tasty tilting effect (` npm install vanilla-tilt`)
- gsap for smooth physic-based animations (used as cdn)

### What I've learned

First time using gsap and physics-based programming in general, working with nodemailer to let the user send me an email from my portfolio page. first time programming a chatbot (but I will have to update it since it's probably not the way it should've been programmed), furthermore I've learned a lot about structuring my files and working with js modules, keeping codebases independent and I think I almost overused CSS and Javascript-animations and by doing that I've also learned a lot. Also haven't used intersection observer in vanilla js before. Plus, whenever I got frustrated with another project, I went back to working on my portfolio because I've had a ton of fun! (vanilla js > react smh)
